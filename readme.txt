Display only parts of a result close to matched search term in search results list

== Description ==

When displaying results from a search many people prefer to display the section of the resulting
post/page that includes the match, rather than the full post or standard excerpt. This plugin adds
a filter to process search results and only display the content either side of the first result
for the given search.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `wp-search-extracts` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
